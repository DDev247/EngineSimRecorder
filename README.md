# EngineSimRecorder
 A recorder for engine-sim with BeamNG.drive exporting capability
## You should now use the new [ESRecorder project](https://github.com/DDev247/ESRecorder) which doesn't require the modloader, supports multithreading and more!
## Warning: This exporter requires the [modloader](https://github.com/mod-loader/engine-sim-modloader)!
